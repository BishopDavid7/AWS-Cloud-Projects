# 🚀 Highly Available AWS Architecture Project (Free Tier)

## **🌟 Project Overview**
This project demonstrates a **highly available and secure AWS architecture** for hosting an application on an **EC2 instance** using the **AWS Free Tier**. The architecture follows industry best practices for **scalability, security, and reliability** using:

- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** – Automatically scales EC2 instances based on traffic load.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** – Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **Bastion Host** – Provides secure SSH access to EC2 instances in private subnets.

## **📌 Features**
✅ **Highly Available & Scalable Architecture**  
✅ **Secure Access via Bastion Host**  
✅ **Automatic Scaling with Auto Scaling Group**  
✅ **Load Balancing for Traffic Distribution**  
✅ **Hosted using AWS Free Tier Services**
